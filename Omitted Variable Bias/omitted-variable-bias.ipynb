    "From the correlation table, we see the correlation between x2 and x3 is 0.369034, revealing a slight positive correlation.\n",

    "### Question 8: You're thinking about estimating the model: y3 = b0+ b1*x1 + b2*x2 + error; that is, you are omitting x3. Before estimating, do you think b2 will be biased? Why or why not? If yes, will b1 be an overestimate or an underestimate?\n",
    "Yes, omitting x3 will make b2 biased. First, we can recognize the correlation between x3 and x1 is insignificant (0.000401). Then, since x3 is positively correlated with x2 and also negatively correlated with y3, if we omit x3, the negative correlation between x3 and y3 will be attributed to x2. This will make it seems like x2 has a more negative correlation with y3 than it actually does such that b2 will be an underestimate.\n",

    "### Question 9: Estimate the model: y3 = b0+ b1*x1 + b2*x2 + error using OLS with robust standard errors. Was your hypothesis in Question 8 correct?\n",
    "Regression with model y3 = b0+ b1*x1 + b2*x2 + error results b0 = -21.1525 and b1 = 0.2005 and b2 = 0.0538. The actual model of the world is y3 = 0.2x1 + 0.1x2 - 13x3 + error where 0.1 is the matching coefficient for b2. Thus, since b2 = 0.0538 < 0.1, b2 is an underestimate, and our hypothesis is correct."
