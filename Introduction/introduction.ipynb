    "You should always document your code with comments to help make your work readable and informative. For example, it is a good idea to write (in words) function inputs and outputs, or what the cells is accomplishing. You can put comments in your code by starting any line with '#'  - anything written in that line will be colored green. \n",

    "You can also easily comment/uncomment multiple lines. Just select multiple lines with your cursor and then press `Cmd and /` (`Ctrl and /` for Windows).\n",

    "After week 3, you will be writing complex web-scapring code that will contain blocks of code within other blocks, and you will need to change the indentation of multiple lines of code. You can indent multiple lines by selecting them and then pressing `Tab`. To de-indent, you press `Shift+Tab` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is a good idea to split up your code into parts that can be run independenly. For example, you can use one cell to install the necessary packages, another one to read in the data, and a third one to transform the data or do analysis. Writing your code out in multiple cells also helps with debugging - you will know exactly which part of your code is throwing you the error.
